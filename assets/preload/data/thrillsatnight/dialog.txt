:narrator:default:Boyfriend explains his situation to Olivia.
:olivia:default:Oh? You think Mario can fix your girlfriend? Hang on, let me check something...
:fade:thrillsatnight1:

:sound:sandrun:
:olivia:default:Yeah, just as I expected, she's stapled. Meaning she's stuck like this... possibly forever.
:bf:default:B-B-B-Beeeep!?

:narrator:default:The news devestated Boyfriend. He fell to his knees and sobbed.
:olivia:default:Oh my!, u-uh... Hey, don't cry!

:sound:hug:
:olivia:default:It's ok, there's still a chance we can fix her!
:olivia:default:Uhm... you can join us on our quest to take down my brother! He's the one who's responsible for all of this.
:bf:default:...
:bf:default:Beep?
:olivia:default:Of course! I'm sure Mario won't mind you two tagging along, right?
:prof:default:Well, I don't see why not. Any extra help is appreciated.
:olivia:default:Great!
:prof:default:Anyways, we'll have to get to that temple. Let's go! I'm dying to see what's inside.

:prof:default:Onward!
:olivia:default:Let's go get that streamer!
:bf:default:Beep!

:prof:default:Oh my, this is fascinating... Just look at how it's constructed, it must be thousands of years old...
:prof:default:And these murals must be of the ancients, where's my journal? I've gotta write this down.
:olivia:default:On a more related note, I wonder what my brother has guarding the yellow streamer.
:prof:default:Oh right... I guess saving the world may be more important.

:narrator:default:The party eventually makes it to what appears to be a massive disco room.
:prof:default:Did the ancients like to party?
:narrator:default:Before his question was answered, a loud voice boomed from the big doors behind them.
:bg:tear:
:bg:flash:
:sound:screenshake:
:devil:blackened:No no no! You think that's groovy?! I thought the king would give me soldiers who had decent taste in music!
:olivia:default:I don't know if the ancients liked to party... but whoever that is sure does.
:olivia:default:Wait, if it's a friend of my brother's, that means the streamer must be in there with them!
:bg:tear:
:bg:flash:
:sound:screenshake:
:devil:blackened:I want to groove, but I ain't coming out until that dance floor is full!
:bg:tear:
:bg:flash:
:sound:screenshake:
:devil:blackened:Also one of you fools, change that trash music this instant!

:narrator:default:The party splits up. While Boyfriend helps pick out a new song, Mario goes looking for people to fill the room.
:bf:default:Beep Boop bada boo.
:dj:default:I'm sorry dude... I-I don't understand you...
:narrator:default: Mario and Professor Toad find a bunch of strange toads that begin to react to the distant music.
:prof:default:Are you sure about this Mario...?

:narrator:default:Once Mario arrived with the crowd of toads, they swarmed Boyfriend and lifted him into the air.
:bg:tear:
:bg:flash:
:bf:default:Beeep!!!
:olivia:default:Eek! What are they doing?
:dj:default:I think that one is challenging him to... sing?
:olivia:default:Why would they want him to do that?
:prof:default:No idea, but we need to keep them here long enough to lure out whoever is guarding that streamer.
:olivia:default:Just... be careful.
